# MNIST Digit Classification with TensorFlow and Keras

This repository contains code for a simple neural network implemented using TensorFlow and Keras to classify digits in the MNIST dataset.

## Project Overview

- The project uses a feedforward neural network architecture to classify hand-written digits.
- It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- You can visualize the training process, including loss and accuracy metrics.
- A few test images and their predictions are also displayed.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (for accuracy calculation)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mnist-digit-classification.git
Install the required Python packages:

pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model.

## Usage
Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model.
You can modify the architecture, hyperparameters, or other aspects to experiment with different configurations.
The test images and their predictions are displayed in the generated plots.

## Results
The model's training progress is visualized with loss and accuracy graphs.
The accuracy score on the test dataset is calculated using scikit-learn.
